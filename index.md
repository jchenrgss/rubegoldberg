## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to construct a visual representation of a real-life process, using a golf ball and various other built components to test and demonstrate energy and momentum-related concepts in physics. The particular model that I have chosen to construct is a representation of the merge sort algorithm, an efficient general-purpose comparison-based sorting algorithm used widely in the field of computer science.

Mergesort is a divide and conquer (top-down recursive) algorithm that runs in logarithmic time and linear space, and works by dividing an unsorted list of n elements into n sublists, each containing one element. The sublists are then merged repeatedly to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining (i.e. the original list, sorted). With a little extension, this process can be redefined in terms of energy and momentum, and represented using a rollercoaster-like machine.

## Description of the Model

### Stage 1: Start to the vertical loop
The golf ball is simply released from the top of the first ramp, and the machine begins to operate. This represents the beginning of execution, and the first division of the original array. No comparisons need to be made at this point, which is why the golf ball moves quickly. The loop and perfectly inelastic collision represent calculations determining where to split the array.

### Stage 2: The first pulley
The original array is split into another subarray and another golf ball is launched to represent another function call. The algorithm moves one level deeper via recursion. When the first golf ball lands in the carriage box, its weights causes the box to drop, extending the string. The string, connected to a pulley above the second golf ball, is attached to the gate preventing the next ball from rolling down the second ramp, so when the pulley is triggered by the first ball, the second is able to begin rolling.
