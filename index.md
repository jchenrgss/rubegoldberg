## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to construct a visual representation of a real-life process, using a golf ball and various other built components to test and demonstrate energy and momentum-related concepts in physics. The particular model that I have chosen to construct is a representation of the merge sort algorithm, an efficient general-purpose comparison-based sorting algorithm used widely in the field of computer science.

Mergesort is a divide and conquer (top-down recursive) algorithm that runs in logarithmic time and linear space, and works by dividing an unsorted list of n elements into n sublists, each containing one element. The sublists are then merged repeatedly to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining (i.e. the original list, sorted).
